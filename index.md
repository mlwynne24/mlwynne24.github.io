### Machine Learning Projects

#### [Long-term Stock Selection using Random Forest and LSTM Models for Fundamental Analysis](https://github.com/mlwynne24/Long-Term-Stock-Selection)
<br><br>
Completed as my MSc Thesis, this project applied investment principles and machine learning models to select annual portfolios of stocks that would outperform the S&P 500 benchmark index. This involved processing a very large dataset of North American fundamental stock data, exploring and visualising the dataset, applying various machine learning models, including Random Forest Regressor (sklearn) and Long-Short Term Memory (PyTorch) models, and simulating and evaluating their performance over a 50-year test period 1970-2021.
