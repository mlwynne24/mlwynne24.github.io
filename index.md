### Machine Learning Projects

#### [Long-term Stock Selection using Random Forest and LSTM Models for Fundamental Analysis](https://github.com/mlwynne24/Long-Term-Stock-Selection)

Completed as my MSc Thesis, this project applied investment principles and machine learning models to select annual portfolios of stocks that would outperform the S&P 500 benchmark index. This involved processing a very large dataset of North American fundamental stock data, exploring and visualising the dataset, applying various machine learning models, including Random Forest Regressor (sklearn) and Long-Short Term Memory (PyTorch) models, and simulating and evaluating their performance over a 50-year test period 1970-2021.

#### [HSBC University Group Project - Using Machine Learning Methods to Extract Trading Signals from Limit Order Book Market Data](https://github.com/mlwynne24/HSBC-Limit-Order-Book-Data-Project-)

This was a 13-week university group project supported by the HSBC Artificial Intelligence team. We were challenged to use machine learning algorithms to generate profits in active trading using level-2 limit order book data. Our execution compared the performance of an highly interpretable decision tree model using handcrafted, interpretable features (e.g. Limit order book imbalance, 10-second order flow imbalance, etc.) to make predictions with a more complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that used unsupervised feature extraction. We created an innovative way to overcome problems associated with market illiquidity and both models generated consistently profitable outcomes in 2 weeks of active trading.
